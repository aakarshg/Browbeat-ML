# Browbeat-ML
Python scripts for Openstack performance machine learning.

Currently working on pulling data out of Elasticsearch and then vectorizing it.
After that we will feed the vectorized data into a Tensorflow model and start
really testing effectiveness and making model tweaks.

The goal for vectorization is to get a dynamic set of Browbeat runs out of Elastic
and order them in a consistent order as a single list of numbers to be fed into the
network.
